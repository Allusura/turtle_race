#Description:
# A simple Python program I made after 20 days of study.
# The program uses the 'turtle' package to create a turtle race
# where the user can guess which turtle wins.

#Things I learned:
# Understanding of the X and Y coordinates within the Turtle package
# Understanding of Objects, Instances and States of Classes within Python
# Difference between Keyword Arguments and Positional Arguments
